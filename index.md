# Overview of Process

4 Step Process. More time spent onearly stages (scoping and prototyping) saves money and time on the later (and more expensive) stages.

## 1. Scoping

We define all the features you need for your site.

* List of pages
* Define any offsite functionality
* Define customer journeys (e.g. What are the steps from landing on your site to checking out?)
* Define admin user workflows (e.g. What is the process for adding a new event to the site?)

## 2. Prototype

We create a prototype that has all the features defined in the previous step.

* Create a mockup of how the site works
* Includes clicks, redirects, general layout...
* But does not include actual design, images, colors, etc
* Used to test functionality and if required, edit the scope

## 3. UI Design 

We design the look of the website.

* Design website layout & UI
* Source Graphics, Images, Icons and Photos
* Create an interactive mockup of the site

## 4. Development

* Website setup
* Inventory system
* Browse/Search system
* Festival Pages and workflow
* Payment Gateway
* Security & Backups
* Email Setup & Basic transactional emails

# Other Costs

## Hosting + Domain Name

Hosting is like buying land for your house. Without it, you can't build anything. The Domain Name is the "www.alex.com" part of your website. It's like putting a custom number plate on your car.

* Hosting: $40/month
* Domain Name: ~$1/month

## Merchant Fees

Since you're taking online payments, you will pay fees on all your transaction. Typically, this is 2-3%. Depending on whether what kind of card the customer pays with.
