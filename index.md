# Overview of Process

4 Step Process. More time spent onearly stages (scoping and prototyping) saves money and time on the later (and more expensive) stages.

## 1. Scoping

* List all pages required for the site
* List all features & functionality
* Define any offsite functionality
* Define customer journeys (e.g. What are the steps from landing on your site to checking out?)
* Define workflows (e.g. What is the process for adding a new event to the site?)
* Back-and-forth process. Client to provide feedback

## 2. Prototype

* Create a mockup of how the site works
* Includes clicks, redirects, general layout...
* But does not include actual design, images, colors, etc
* Used to test functionality and if required, edit the scope
* Back-and-forth process. Client to provide feedback

## 3. UI Design 

* Design website layout
* Design website UI
* Source Graphics, Images, Icons and Photos
* Create an interactive mockup of the site
* Back-and-forth process. Client to provide feedback

## 4. Development

* Basic setup
* SSL Setup
* Inventory system
* Browse/Search system
* Festival Pages
* Security & Backups
* Payment Gateway
* Email Setup
* Email Autoresponders
* New Festival/Product workflow

# Pricing

A high estimate is provided below. Prices could be lower depending on scope (see below).

## Developer Costs

* Scoping: $150
* Tech Prototype: $450
* UI Design: $2500
* Development: $3000

## Third Party Mandatory Costs:

Ongoing costs of owning a website. Not part of development costs:

* Domain Name: $13/year
* Hosting: $40/month (for a low-traffic site)

## Third Party Addons:

For some functionalities, it might not make sense to custom-develop them. Instead, we would use a third party plugin/addon instead. This 10x cheaper than developing them from scratch.

The following won't be added into the grand total, but it gives you an idea of what to expect if you want extra functionality:

* Social Proof (popups that read "John from Canley Heights just purchased xyz product 2 minutes ago"): ~$15/month
* Custom Email Marketing: $15/month (increases the more customers you have)


Total Cost:
  Developer: $6,100
  Third Party Mandatory: $53/month
  Third Party Addons: $33/month
  Grand Total: $6,100 + $86/month


No Design:
  $4,100 + $86/month
  Less customisable
  Can do tweaks here and there but some customizations won't be possible


Bare Bones Version (shopify):
  One product (bundle) per festival
